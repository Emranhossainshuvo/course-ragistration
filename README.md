## About this project

Here are three features of this project:

- There is a limit of credit of the projects if you go out of credit you can't select a product anymore.
- You'll able to see live remaining and spent credit in the website. 
- If you try to select a product having no credit or is you try to select a product twice you'll see a toast 





## How I managed the state in my assignment project:

* First of all it was hard to me as my first assignment with react. I became confused with these states. 

* The states were very helpfull to store data specially when I work for the remaining and total credit. 

* I put avery number or data in states which I will try to access from outside of that component.
