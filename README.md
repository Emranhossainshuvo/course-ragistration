## About this project

Here are three features of this project:

- There is a credit limit for products, and once you spend all of your credit, you won't be able to select any more products.

- You'll see live remaining and spent credit in the website. 

- If you try to select a product without any available credit or try to select a product that you've already chosen, you'll receive a toast message.





## How I managed the state in my assignment project:

First of all it was challenging to me as it was my first assignment with react. I became confused while dealing with these states. The states were very helpfull to store data, specially when I work with the remaining and total credit. I put numbers and objects in states, intending to access them from external components when necessary.
